# Current structure of the App

## Outside the React scope  

1. We have four classes  

  - **PersistentStorage**: It interacts with `LocalStorage` and `State`. It has `read()` and `write()` methods.   
  - **TemporaryStorage**: It interacts with `temporaryData`. It has `read()` and `write()` methods. It is used in tests.
  - **Router**: It gets information about the changes in URL, updates its `pathname` and accordingly selects the route. `Router.route` decides on what to display eventually.
  - **State**: It has user data from `LocalStorage`. It contains all the actions for user to change data. It updates `LocalStorage` when data is changed.  

2. Database is LocalStorage

  - It has the following default data structure:

  ```
  data: {
    showCompleted: false,
    categories: ['My Todos', 'Home Related', 'Work Related', 'Groceries'],
    todos: [] 
  }
  ```
  - Each todo item is an `Object` within `todos` array.

## Inside the React scope

1. **`index.js`** 

  - It creates an instance of `PersistentStorage`, `db`.
  - It creates an instance of `State`, `repo` with `db`.
  - It creates an instance of `Router`, `router`. 
  - It renders `App` with `router` and `repo` as its props. 
  - `repo` and `router` listen to changes in their instance variables. When they catch a change, they re-render `App` as a callback. 

2. **App**

  - It renders two components in a two-column format: `Sidebar` and `Content`. 
  - `Sidebar` shows a list of categories of todo items. These categories can be renamed or deleted. Clicking category names will change the URL. Pathname becomes the category name. Here `router` updates `route`.   
  - `Sidebar` also has a button to search within todo item titles. Clicking `search` button will change the URL. Here `router` updates `route`. 
  - `Sidebar` makes it possible to add a new category.  
  - `Content` toggles between `search` view or `content` view, depending on the URL. 

3. **App -> Sidebar**

  - It renders three components: `Search`, `CategoryList` and `NewCategory`.  
  - `Search` starts with a search button. Clicking the search button, changes the URL to "/search" and brings an `input` field.  
  - `CategoryList` renders a list of categories with each item as `Category` components. If a `Category` is in editing mode, then `EditingCategory` is rendered instead.  
  - `NewCategory` makes it possible to add a new category. 

4. **App -> Sidebar -> Search**

  - User search input is captured in the URL, after `?`. `router` doesn't update `route` but its `pathname`.
  - When `Search` is active, `SearchResults` is rendered in the right column.  

5. **App -> Sidebar -> CategoryList**

  - Clicking a category changes the URL. This causes `MainSection` in the right column to render todo items within that category. 

6. **App -> Sidebar -> NewCategory**  

  - It has its own state to capture user input. 

7. **App -> Content**

  - It renders either `SearchResults` **or** `MainSection` component. This decision is based on the URL, set by `Sidebar -> Search` component. 
  - `SearchResults` renders a list of todo items with each item as `Todo` or `EditingTodo` component. In this sense each item is editable. 
  - `SearchResults` gets the search term from the URL and accordingly displays the relevant todo items. It has also a `Reset Search` button which resets the search input. 
  - `MainSection` is rendered if `route` is not "search" and pathname is within `repo.data.categories`.  

8. **App -> Content -> SearchResults**

  - This is the list of search results. Each todo item displayed can be edited on the spot. 

9. **App -> Content -> MainSection**

  - It renders three components: `NewTodo`, `TodoList` and `ShowCompletedToggler`.
  - `NewTodo` makes it possible to add a new todo. New todo item has to have a title but can be created without due date. It gets its category value from the URL. It has its own state to capture the changes in title input or due date input. 
  - `TodoList` renders a list of todo items with each item as a `Todo` component. If a `Todo` is in editing mode, then `EditingTodo` is rendered instead. `EditingTodo` makes it possible to change category, title and due date of the component. Each `Todo` can be checked, which removes the `Todo` from view.

# Week-27 Tasks and Progress

1. Please start this week by opening a pull request with the title “Week 27”.

- Done.

2. Please add an instruction how to use automatic formatting in the README file.

-

3. Implement unit tests for the State class:

  • addTodo(“Hello”, null) should add todo with a title “Hello" to the storage
    - [commit](https://github.com/rdzcn/mk-todo/commit/46f553b5564af036f181c3663db97a82b40e005a)
  • addTodo(null, null) should not add a todo to the storage
    - [commit](https://github.com/rdzcn/mk-todo/commit/46f553b5564af036f181c3663db97a82b40e005a)
  • completeTodo should complete and uncompleted todos in the storage
    -
  • saveTodo should save the editing title in the storage
    -
  • deleteTodo should remove the todo from the storage
    -

4. Make sorter a function and not a string. const sortedTodos = sorter(todos). Add unit tests for every sorter we have.


5. Implement tests for these filters.


6. Implement renaming of lists. I would like to create lists like Groceries, Family, Work etc. Begin by adding unit tests for it.

 - Implemented by making `Category` to function like `Todo`. Hence, `NewCategory`, `Category`, `EditingCategory` and `CategoryList`.

7. Implement the following: currently selected list ID needs to be visible in the `window.location.href: https://deploy-preview-6--angry-goldstine-203e71.netlify.com/groceries` should open the “Groceries” list, also when I reload the page. When I click on the Groceries list, it should change the URL too, without reloading the page.



8. Implement `ShowCompletedToggler` component. It should accept repo as its only parameter. It should contain all the logic whether to show “Show” or “Hide” button, and it should interact with the repo directly.

- Done. [commit](https://github.com/rdzcn/mk-todo/pull/10/commits/bc4908ab14ea22fe148a7fc891a74067cf37ca28)

9. Implement moving tasks between lists. Begin by adding unit tests for it.

  - Did it but again not starting with the tests. Tests to follow.

10. Very difficult, I don’t expect you to finish it this week: add a search field that would search all of the todo titles in the State. When user starts entering text “foo" in the search field, the title of the list changes to “Search for ‘foo'” and only the todos with the ‘foo’ in their title show up in the TodoList. Add unit tests for this function.

- Tests are missing. [commit](https://github.com/rdzcn/mk-todo/commit/0d67dd11258e35855f2166908ac0b9a571dd18a5)

# Ideas to implement

1. Only one kind of editing can be done simultaneously: either edit `category` or `todo`.
